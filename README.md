## Overview

This project is a number of things. At its core, it is an open-source repository of debate metadata, culled from Tabroom and earlier archives. I'm also including the tools used to gather the info, in case anyone wants to check (or continue) the work. There are a number of tournaments with missing info, and I'm working to catch any data translation errors, so pull requests are welcome.

## Data Omissions/Working

Generally, if I don't have complete data for a tournament division, I don't include it.

### 2017-2018 (Tabroom)
* Kentucky: no speaker points for JV or novice.
* UCF: no round-by-round results (nor cumulatives?).
* CSUF Fall: no results posted.
* NW Fall Champs: novice speaks not posted
* Cal Swing 1: Open finals missing 1 vote
* Miami: Novice breakout finals results look wonky (judge decisions appear differently on each team's results page).
* New School: Open finals don't list complete ballot results
* D6: No speaks.
* D4: basically no results
* D8: No speaks.
* ADA: No speaks in open and jv (but yes for novice?)

### 2016-2017 (Tabroom)
* Rochester: no speaker points
* UNI: no speaker points
* Rutgers: no speaker points
* Golden Gate Opener: no speaker points
* West Point: no speaker points
* KCKCC: no JV/novice results (I think this is on purpose - but noting for now)
* Gonzaga: finals?
* Vermont: no speaks
* UCO: no speaks
* Monmouth: no speaks
* ADA Fall: Something wonky happened with sems results but I assumed that the half-complete speaker points were deletable
* Wake: finals?
* Illinois college: no results
* West Georgia: no results
* Southwestern: novice round 4 breaks me for some reason.
* Indiana: novice prelim results aren't showing up under "results"
* Gotham Scrimmage: no speaks
* Cornell: no speaks
* MAC: no results (novice) or speaks (open)
* D6: no speaks
* D5: no speaks. But they might not have been assigned. I need to think about how to categorize this (an "elim-style" prelim?)
* Binghamton NE Regional: no speaks
* D8: no speaks
* D7: no speaks
* D4: no results
* JV/novice nats WVU: no speaks
* NJDDT: no novice speaks

### 2015-2016
* UNI: no novice results
* Weber: no JV finals
* UCF: no results
* West Point: no speaks
* Houston: no speaks
* UNI novice: no results
* Navy: no round-by-round results/speaker points
* Wichita: no JV speaks

### 2013-2014
* NDT: There's some weirdness going on with some Indiana entries (I think drops?). I pulled those rounds out for now.

## Ideas for running data
* Most pref'd judges: gather round commitment data (eugh) and divide by rounds judged
* 1st round voting stuff
* ELO stuff
  * Likelihood of upsets dependent on various factors? Sides? location? Length of tournament
  * PageRank/Eigenvalue stuff vs ELO (recency bias good/bad?)
* Tournament distance/travel stuff
